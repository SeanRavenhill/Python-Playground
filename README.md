### Project: Bill Splitter

#### About
Everyone likes eating out with friends. The more friends, the better, but the bill time is always a bummer, to say the least. Why not develop a tool to keep the fun alive and make sure that everyone pays an equal amount.

#### Learning outcomes
Work on your Python basics and take a look at more advanced data structures such as dictionaries. Develop an app for managing expenses during your next dine-out.

#### *Personal Notes:
Interesting and fun project. Obviously the real world practicality of this is a little obscure. Would be far easier to do this sort of arithmetic by looking at the  bill and then splitting the total with something like a calculator on a smart phone. However the project and the topics leading up to it did provide me with some interesting new learnings. Specifically when it comes to Exception handling. I was not aware that there where the additional keywords of ***else*** and ***finally***. This may come in useful in the future.

I may add something like an option for gratuity etc in the future. And see where I may be able to streamline the script. But for now I'm happy with how this turned out. Onto the next project! :)
