#### About
Just a space for me to retain any scripts I may find useful or interesting. A space to practice new concepts and to prototype scripts. Also a handy way to work on blocks of script for larger program scripts independently and avoid having to comment out many lines of code if I'm working on bugs and error traces etc.
